to buy and sell
[7,8,3,4,5]
if we buy at 7 we can sell it at the 8 profit by getting the 1 rupee profit'
consider a 'a' be some variable with infinity value
consider a 'b' be some variable of max cal
update a with small value and b with the max(b,i-a)


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        a=10**4
        b=0
        for i in prices:
            if a>i:
                a=i
            else:
                b=max(b,i-a)
        return b
